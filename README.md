🚀Excited to share that I’ve completed my latest embedded systems project:    ->>>>   LIFT prj working flow 
 “Smart Lift Cabin Automation using PIR and IR Sensors” 💡🛗
In this project, I used:
 🔹 PIR Sensor to detect human motion
 🔹 IR Sensor to monitor presence or absence after entry
 🔹 STM32F401RE Nucleo Board programmed using bare-metal C
 🔹 2-channel relay module controlled via transistors to switch fan and light
 🔹 Designed and simulated in Proteus – now moving to hardware development in the next 1–2 weeks! 🔧

🧠 Project Logic:
PIR Sensor detects human presence
IR Sensor detects entry/exit motion
👇 Control Logic:
🔹 PIR HIGH + IR HIGH → Fan & Light ON
🔹 PIR LOW + IR HIGH → Fan ON (human still inside)
🔹 IR LOW → Fan & Light OFF

📌 Key Features:
✅ Automatically turns on fan and light when human motion is detected
 ✅ Turns off both once the person has passed the IR sensor
 ✅ Energy-efficient and fully automated using dual sensor logic
 ✅ Ideal for lift cabins, restrooms, or confined spaces
This was a hands-on learning experience in embedded C, GPIO control, sensor integration, and real-time system design.
🔜 Stay tuned for the hardware implementation update soon!
